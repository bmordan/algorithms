# Algorithms

Here is a repository of classic computer science algorithms. I have not had the opportunity to study computer science so want to school myself a bit more after a string of failed tech tests! Here I hope to gain some idea about some genuinely useful solutions.

## Heap's permutations

This is my first one. Actually a useful method this will take an array, and return you an Array of all the possible permutations for that array.

```sh
node heaps.js [1,2,3]
[
  [ 1, 2, 3 ],
  [ 2, 1, 3 ],
  [ 3, 1, 2 ],
  [ 1, 3, 2 ],
  [ 2, 3, 1 ],
  [ 3, 2, 1 ]
]
```
